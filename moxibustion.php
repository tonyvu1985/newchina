			<h1>Moxibustion</h1>
			<p>Moxibustion is claimed to be the oldest form of therapy in China. It has been a part of acupuncture for thousands of years. It involves the burning of the moxa herb artemisia vulgaris on or above the skin at acupuncture points to alleviate symptoms. It includes direct moxibustion using moxa sticks and indirect moxibustion using monkshood cakes or ginger, garlic slices to insulate the skin.</p>
			<p>The patient will experience a pleasant heating sensation that penetrates deep into the skin, but should not experience any pain, burning, blistering or scarring unless the moxa is left in place for too long.</p>
			<p>In traditional Chinese medicine, moxibustion is used on people who have a cold or stagnant condition. The burning of moxa is believed to expel cold and warm the meridians, which leads to smoother flow of blood and qi. It also eases pain, reduces the symptoms of menstrual cramps, successfully turns a breeched foetus, helps acute lymphangitis and enhances physiological and immune functions of the body. </p>
