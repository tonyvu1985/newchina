			<h1>Acupuncture</h1>
			<p>Acupuncture has been practiced in China for more than 5,000 years. Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medical technique for unblocking qi by inserting needles at particular acupoints on the body to balance the opposing forces of yin and yang. Qi is an energy that allegedly permeates all things. It is believed to flow through the body along 14 main pathways called meridians.  When yin and yang are in harmony the qi flows freely within the body and a person is healthy. When a person is sick, diseased, or injured, there is an obstruction of qi along one or more of these meridians. Traditional Chinese medicine has identified some 500 specific points where needles are inserted for specific effects.</p>

			<p>The acupuncturist is able to influence health and sickness by stimulating certain areas along these "meridians". Traditionally these areas or acupoints were stimulated by fine, slender needles. Today, many additional forms of stimulation are incorporated, including herbs, electricity, magnets and lasers.</p>
