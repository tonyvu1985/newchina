			<h1>Tui na (Theraputic Massage)</h1>
			<p>Tui meaning “push” and Na meaning “grasp”. Tui Na massage therapy is based on traditional Chinese medicine and acupressure. It is composed of over 20 manipulations and techniques based on the theory of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). It provides excellent results in relaxation, rehabilitation and the promotion of general well-being. It also enhances the effect of acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine. It is particularly effective in treating injuries of tendons, muscles, joints and organ disorders, and in regulating and harmonizing the flow of qi and blood throughout the meridians.</p>
			<p>Tui Na uses many different strokes that are applied to acupressure points, channels and muscle groups. It is believed that the strokes and techniques stimulate an exchange of qi between the practitioner and the patient. It was was developed in China over 2,000 years ago. It works with the energy system in the body known as the meridian system. Like Acupuncture, Tui Na works with the qi energy of the patient to bring a balanced state of health. But unlike, acupuncture, no needles are used. The work is done entirely with the practitioner's hands to help increase the beneficial flow of qi through the patient's meridian system.</p>
			<p>One of the most basic forms of massage, and also one of the most commonly used, Tui Na massage utilizes many different strokes and techniques. The following is a list of many of the different techniques a Tui Na massage therapist may use some or all of:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Grasping</li>
				<li>Rubbing</li>
				<li>Penetrating</li>
				<li>Pressing</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The practitioner of Tui Na massage will use a variety of techniques to apply these methods, including making use of his fingers, thumb, knuckles, palm, and elbow. This is necessary in order to be able to activate the pressure points so that energy can freely flow as it should.
			<p>There are many benefits that can be achieved through Tui Na, including the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Healing</strong>— with any massage, especially one that enables the natural energy flow to resume, the patient will experience some form of healing. It isn’t that the body is healed by the massage, though. Instead, the body becomes able—through the massage—to begin to heal itself.</li>
				<li><strong>Increased circulation</strong>— this includes increased and better circulation of the body’s natural energy, the blood flow within the body, as well as the circulation of the lymphatic system.</li>
				<li><strong>Relaxation</strong>— Tui Na provides its patients with much relaxation, which can lead to less stress, and therefore create better health.</li>
				<li><strong>Pain relief</strong>— Tui Na massage provides pain relief to those muscles and joints of the body that may be holding onto too much energy. By releasing this energy, Tui Na allows the patient to be relieved of any pain that may have been caused by it. Also helps rheumatic pain, tiredness, lack of energy and any symptoms caused by stress of emotional problems. </li>
