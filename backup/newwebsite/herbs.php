			<h1>Chinese Herbal Medicine</h1>
			<p>Chinese herbs are prescribed to harmonise or correct imbalanced energy, qi that runs through invisible meridians in the body. The herbs used are imported from China where their use dates back at least two thousand years. Chinese herbal medicines are successful in treating a range of disorders, particularly gynaecological and gastrointestinal disorders.</p>
			<p>Using the natural properties and flavours of medicinal substances to restore and balance the entire body energy. For over 3000 years, it has played an important role in preventing and treating disease as well as improving longevity. Chinese Herbal Medicine treats any disorders and diseases through internal or external absorption. Since Chinese herbs have different tastes, properties, natures, functions and entering channels, they can affect the flow of Qi and blood, and the balance of Yin and Yang of the human body.</p>
Chinese herbs are commonly used to treat disorders such as:
			<ul>
				<li>Colds & Flu</li>
				<li>Digestive problems</li>
				<li>Eczema and psoriasis</li>
				<li>Fatigue</li>
				<li>Gynaecological disorders</li>
				<li>Hepatic (liver) disorders</li>
				<li>Jaundice, Tuberculosis</li>
				<li>Cardiovascular disorders</li>
				<li>Stress</li>
				<li>Allergies and autoimmune disorders</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Chinese herbal medicines are mainly plant based, but some preparations include minerals or animal products. They can be packaged as raw herbs, liquids, powders, granules or tablets depending on the herb and its intended use. Different herbs have different properties and can balance particular parts of the body. Prescribing a particular herb or concoction of herbs means the practitioner’s diagnosis has to take into account the state of the patient’s yin and yang, and the elements that are governing the affected organs.</p>
			<p>Raw herbs required the patient to soak, boil, strain, re-boil, re-strain, etc. to get the resulting decoction. Most herb formulas consist of four to eight herbs and treat a wide variety of symptoms while stimulating the body’s natural healing process. There are complex relationships between the different components of a prescription, and much skill is needed to select the most appropriate combination of herbs to compose a balanced and effective formula specific to your needs.</p>
