	<!--		<p>Chinese herbal medicines are mainly plant based, but some preparations include minerals or animal products. They can be packaged as raw herbs, liquids, powders, granules or tablets depending on the herb and its intended use. Different herbs have different properties and can balance particular parts of the body. Prescribing a particular herb or concoction of herbs means the practitioner’s diagnosis has to take into account the state of the patient’s yin and yang, and the elements that are governing the affected organs.</p>
			<p>Raw herbs required the patient to soak, boil, strain, re-boil, re-strain, etc. to get the resulting decoction. Most herb formulas consist of four to eight herbs and treat a wide variety of symptoms while stimulating the body’s natural healing process. There are complex relationships between the different components of a prescription, and much skill is needed to select the most appropriate combination of herbs to compose a balanced and effective formula specific to your needs.</p>-->
